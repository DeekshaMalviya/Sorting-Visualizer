# Sorting Visualizer

This project is a web-based application that visually demonstrates various sorting algorithms, including Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Heap Sort, and Bubble Sort. The application is built using React.js and provides an interactive interface where users can generate a new array, adjust the array size, and control the sorting speed.

## Features
  Interactive Controls: Generate new arrays of bars with random heights.
  Adjustable Parameters: Modify the size of the array and the speed of the sorting animations.
  Sorting Algorithms: Visualize different sorting algorithms in action:
    Merge Sort
    Quick Sort
    Heap Sort
    Bubble Sort
  Dynamic Visualization: The array bars change color and height dynamically to represent the sorting process.
